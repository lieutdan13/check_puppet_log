Check Puppet Log
----------------

Checks /var/log/messages for general puppet-agent problems. The status will not return to 'green' until the problem is fixed.

This plugin checks /var/log/messages for various errors output by the puppet agent. Sometimes this plugin will not show that an error has cleared until the puppet agent has run twice.
